This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error can lead to unexpected results or program crashes.  The solution involves carefully checking array indices before accessing elements.
